## üéÆ Game Mechanics

### Tank Attributes
- **Health** (0-100): When it reaches 0, tank respawns after 5 seconds
- **Speed** (5-50): Controls tank movement speed
- **Gasoline** (0-100): When empty, speed is reduced by 50%
- **Rotation** (5-50): Controls how fast the tank can turn
- **Ammunition** (0-14): Number of shots available
- **Kinetics** (50-300): Bullet speed

### Upgrades
- **S** (Speed): +20 speed points
- **G** (Gasoline): +80 gasoline points
- **R** (Rotation): +20 rotation points
- **A** (Ammunition): +7 ammunition
- **K** (Kinetics): +30 kinetics points
- **H** (Health): +10 health points

### Damage System
When hit by a bullet, tanks lose:
- 1 Health point
- 5 Speed points
- 5 Rotation points
- 10 Kinetics points
- 5 Gasoline points

### AI Behavior
- **Hunt Mode**: When health > 50%, AI seeks nearest enemy
- **Survival Mode**: When health < 50%, AI prioritizes upgrades
- **Smart Targeting**: AI aims and shoots at enemies within range
- **Resource Management**: AI collects upgrades based on needs

## üîß Configuration
